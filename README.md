# Orinoco

This project is the front-end of Orinoco, a new online shopping site.
The backend/API was provided and the goal here was to make the whole front-end from scatch, according to the MVP specs.

## üìå <u>Funtionalities required for the MVP</u>:

<ins>4 pages as follows</ins>:

- [x] 1 "list" view of all available products
- [x] 1 ‚Äúproduct‚Äù view, dynamically displaying the item selected by the user, with options to select from + "add to cart" functionality
- [x] 1 "cart" view, with the whole recap of the items in the cart + total price + form.  
      The form has to be validated before getting sent to the back-end (i.e. no empty fields, invalid email etc...)
- [x] 1 "confirmation" view displaying a thank you message + total price + order ID sent back from the backend.

<ins>1 plan for test cases/unit tests (must cover 80% of the code base)</ins>

## üíª <u>To see the project on your machine</u>:

### <ins>Prerequisites</ins>:

You will need to have Node and `npm` or `yarn` installed locally on your machine.

### <ins>Steps</ins>:

**1.** Clone this repo.

**2.** Open the terminal from within the project folder and run the command `npm install`.  
You should now have all the dependencies installed (+ node_modules folder)

**3.** Launch the server with the command `node server`.  
The server should now be running on `localhost` with default port `3000`.  
If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

**4.** Open the `index.html` file with Live Server or the way you prefer.

üöÄ You should now see and use the project! Enjoy!
